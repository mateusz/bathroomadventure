# Bathroom Adventure

A hand-drawn adventure game made with kids. Short but complete, with a sprinkling of absurdity: the protagonist is stuck in their apartment and needs to find the spare key to get out!

Suitable for general audience.

Made with [AGS6](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/).

Controls:

- **left click** or **tap** -> action
- **right click** -> look (but you don't need to look at things to finish the game)
